<h1>Localization Spreadsheet JSONify</h1>

<pre>
To use this app:

First, create a localization spreadsheet that looks like <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqrUvD5TZZs3dF9ULUh5X1JlakVJRGFHaWRZQmFuZEE" target="_blank">this one</a>.

Make sure the spreadsheet you want to use is public or that you are logged in 
and have at least view access to it.

Then, simply call <a href="<?= ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() ?>"><?= ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() ?></a> 
with the following querystring parameters set:

sheet_id         required       ex: 0AqrUvD5TZZs3dF9ULUh5X1JlakVJRGFHaWRZQmFuZEE
sheet_name       required       ex: Main
threshold        optional       ex: 0.8
callback         optional       ex: languageLoader

Try it out:
<form action="<?= ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() ?>" method="GET">
<input type="text" name="sheet_id"   size="55" placeholder="Enter Spreadsheet ID"/><input type="text" name="sheet_name" size="20" placeholder="Enter Sheet name"/><input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>

Parameters:

<strong>sheet_id</strong>

    The key parameter from a Google Spreadsheet URL, e.g. 
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=<strong>0AqrUvD5TZZs3dF9ULUh5X1JlakVJRGFHaWRZQmFuZEE</strong>"

<strong>sheet_name</strong>

    The sheet name to use inside of the spreadsheet.

<strong>threshold</strong>

    Controls the percentage of fully-translated strings a translation must have
    before it is deployable. In other words, if you have 10 total strings, and
    your threshold is 0.8, then at least 8 of the strings in a translation must
    be set, or the language is not considered deployable.
    
<strong>callback</strong>

    JSONP callback function name, which can then load the translations into the 
    current page.

For example, <a href="<?= ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() ?>?sheet_id=0AqrUvD5TZZs3dF9ULUh5X1JlakVJRGFHaWRZQmFuZEE&sheet_name=Main" target="_blank">this URL</a>, will generate a JSON string translation table using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqrUvD5TZZs3dF9ULUh5X1JlakVJRGFHaWRZQmFuZEE" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a>.

The output from the script will be a hashtable/dictionary with keys set to the
language_codes in the spreadsheet:

{
    "de": {
            "hello": "Guten Tag!",
            "how_are_you": "Wie geht's?",
            "language_code": "de",
            "language_name": "Deutsch",
            "string_with_comma": "Mit, Komma",
            "string_with_newlines": "Mit \n\n",
            "string_with_quotes": "Mit \"\"",
            "test_label": "Feldname:",
            "text_direction": "ltr"
          },
    "en": { ... },
    "fr": { ... },
        
    [and so on ...]
}

If you have country-specific translations, it is recommended that you add them
to the table after non-country-specific base translations. In other words, if 
you have a translation for "de" and one for "de-AT", put the "de-AT" translation
in a column to the right of "de". The localization script will apply the base 
translation to unfilled cells in the country-specific translation.
